/** @file glx.h
 *
 * Provides an implementation of a GLX dispatch layer using a hidden
 * vtable.
 *
 * This is a lower performance path than ifuncs when they are
 * available, but it is required if you might have multiple return
 * values for GetProcAddress/dlsym()ed functions (for example, if you
 * unload libGL.so.1).
